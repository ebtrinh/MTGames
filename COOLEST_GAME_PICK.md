# My Pick: Territory Control

Out of all the game ideas, **Territory Control** would be the coolest to build and play on a large IR frame TV.

## Why Territory Control Wins

### It Maximizes the Hardware
- Uses the **entire screen** - no wasted space
- Benefits from **multi-touch** with all players acting simultaneously
- Large display makes the "battlefield" feel epic
- Simple touch/drag mechanics that IR frames handle perfectly

### Emergent Chaos
The best party games create stories. Territory Control would generate moments like:
- "I was about to win and then three people ganged up on me"
- Last-second comebacks from a tiny corner
- Temporary alliances forming and breaking
- The tension of watching borders creep toward your zone

### Easy to Learn, Hard to Master
- **5-second explanation**: "Tap to expand your color, capture others by surrounding them"
- But strategy emerges: Do you expand fast or consolidate? Attack the leader or grab unclaimed land? Defend or go aggressive?

### Scales Perfectly
- Works with 2 players (head-to-head duel)
- Works with 4 players (chaotic free-for-all)
- Could even support 6+ on a big enough screen
- Game length adjusts naturally based on player count

### Visually Satisfying
- Color floods spreading across the screen
- Borders shifting in real-time
- Clear winner/loser states at a glance
- Opportunities for juicy animations when territory is captured

- Each player taps/drags to expand from their corner
- Territory spreads like ink
- Surround enemy territory to capture it
- Most territory when time runs out wins
```

## Core Mechanics

1. **Expansion**: Hold/drag to grow your territory in that direction
2. **Capture**: Fully surround an enemy pocket to convert it to your color
3. **Neutral zones**: Unclaimed gray areas anyone can grab
4. **Power-ups** (optional): Speed boost, freeze others, territory bomb

## Why Not the Others?

| Game | Issue |
|------|-------|
| Air Hockey | Fun but limited - only 2-4 players, small interaction zones |
| Fruit Ninja | Already exists everywhere, less novel |
| Tower Defense | Cooperative is great but less party energy |
| Trivia | Relies heavily on content creation |
| Music Mixer | Cool but more of a toy than a game |

Territory Control hits the sweet spot of **competitive**, **chaotic**, **simple**, and **visually impressive**.

## Next Steps If Building This

1. Prototype basic expansion mechanic (tap to grow circles)
2. Add collision detection between territories
3. Implement capture logic (flood fill surrounded areas)
4. Polish with colors, animations, sound
5. Add timer and win condition
6. Playtest and balance expansion speed
